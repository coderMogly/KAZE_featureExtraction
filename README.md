# KAZE_featureExtraction
The aim of the code is to extract features out of images and prepare a database of feature that might be further used to search for specific images in a large scene. The keypoints and feature vectors are then stored in pickle files. The code also provides a user to then scan through the feature and decide if that particular feature defines the image or not. 

It is a part of series of code using KAZE to work with images.
